# Psy-sMiscHackingScripts
A collection of short scripts to do deal with some file formats for various games, or perform other tasks.

Those are nothing special, and not worth their own repository. But someone might have some use for those, or maybe not. But, in any cases, I put those here.

Everything is Public Domain, or Creative Common 0, whichever fits your purpose/local crappyrights laws the best. ;)
